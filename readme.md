# Portugal News' Hub
<br>

## Description

Portugal News Hub is a full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application designed to aggregate news articles from various Portuguese newspapers into a single, unified platform. Built during my time at the Ironhack bootcamp, this project aims to provide readers with a broad perspective on topics ranging from economy and politics to sports by pulling articles from multiple sources. This is an effort to combat the spread of biased information.
